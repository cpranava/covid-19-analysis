# Covid-19-tracker

## Problem Statement:
To build an application that tracks the list of people the user has come in contact with and notifies them if any of the said people are tested to be COVID positive.

### Situation
COVID-19 has taken the world by force. Today not only has it claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, it has also changed the lives of our civilization on a global landscape.

### Complication
1. According to CDC, coronavirus 'does not spread easily' from touching surfaces or objects but spreads "very easily and sustainably between people"
2. Lockdown for prolonged periods of time is not feasible and is just "prolonging" the inevitable

### Question and Answer
How do we effectively identify future cases through automated contact tracing?
Can I use the gathered data to form cluster of locations and shut down them from the general public?

### Technology stacks used
1. Android/iOS/React-Native
2. Azure Database
3. iVentura to perform clustering on data stores in the Azure DB.
